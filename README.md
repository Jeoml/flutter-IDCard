# Flutter ID Card

This ID card happens to be one of the projects which I upload to github as I learn Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. I like OnePiece, so I made this ID Card for a character named Zoro from that Anime/Manga.

The application is probably the most basic yet a bit beautified version of flutter applications which you can find out there on the internet.
